# tla-plus-onramp

TLA+ tutes &amp; intro to formal verification methods.

## What is this?

Learning by teaching; TLA+ tutorials broken down by following lessons from the [LearnTLA](https://learntla.com/introduction/) site.

## Setup

Install the [TLA+ Toolbox software](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html).

If you want, feel free to get the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alygin.vscode-tlaplus). I find the modern tooling environment here more familiar, albeit less powerful.
